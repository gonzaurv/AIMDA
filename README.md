# AIMDA
This repository is aimed at obtaining informationÂ from wave function files (generated by Gaussian) using Multiwfn, an open-source program for wavefunction analysis. It includes a Python script to automate the process and rename the outputs.

**Note:** This project is a work in progress and will be continuously updated throughout 2025.

## 1. Prerequisites
Before running the automation script, ensure the following:

**Gaussian:** Install Gaussian to generate .wfn files. Refer to [Gaussian's official site](https://gaussian.com/) for installation instructions.
**Multiwfn:** Download and set up Multiwfn:
Visit [Multiwfn's homepage](http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/) and download the latest version.
Extract the program files.
Ensure Multiwfn.exe is available in the same directory as the automation script.

## 2. How to Use
**Step 1:** Prepare Your Directory
Place the following files in the same directory:

.wfn files generated by Gaussian.
comando_multiwfn.txt: Predefined commands for Multiwfn (provided in this repository).
run_multiwfn_and_rename.py: The Python automation script.

**Step 2:** Install Python Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. No additional libraries are needed for this script. If you don't have Python, download it from python.org.

**Step 3:** Run the Script
Run the script to process all .wfn files in the directory:

    
    python read_wfn.py
    
    
The script will:
1. Execute Multiwfn for each .wfn file using comando_multiwfn.txt.
2. Rename the outputs (CPs.txt, CPprop.txt, etc.) for each file.

## 3. Automation Script:
run_multiwfn_and_rename.py
This script automates running Multiwfn and renaming outputs.

## 4. Command File:
comando_multiwfn.txt
This file defines the step-by-step commands for Multiwfn to process .wfn files.

## 5. Output Files
The script renames the following files for each .wfn input:

CPprop.txt
CPs.txt
 For example, if your input is molecule.wfn, the outputs will be:
filename_CPprop.txt filename_CPs.txt

## 6. Notes
Ensure Multiwfn.exe is in the same directory as the script.
Edit comando_multiwfn.txt if additional Multiwfn commands are needed.
